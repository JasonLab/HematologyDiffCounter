# HematologyDiffCounter
Differential Counter for Hematology. 
Standard diff counter program. Pressing the key on your keyboard increments the counter for the appropriate cell. Also includes a feature for viewing the most recent cells entered 
in case of an error. 

Please note the nRBC correction is based off of a formula that corrects the analyzer WBC count based of of the difference between the end user's nRBC manual
count and the analyzer nRBC count. This may not be appropriate at all clinical sites or with all instrumentation. Please consult your local policies.
